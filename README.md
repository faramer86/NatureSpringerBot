# NatureSpringerBot
This is Telegram bot that uses Springer Nature API to get up-to-date nature articles and send them to several Telegram channels.

**NOTE:** we do not download pdf versions of articles, we simply send inform messages with title, abstract and web link to official web version of the article. Thus, we believe, we do not violate any laws.
